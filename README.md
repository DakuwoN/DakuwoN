# 👋 Hi, I'm Matthew
I am currently a freshman at Arizona State University. I am looking for internships at Microsoft or Amazon. I am also a fellow at Formation, a community of top tier
software engineers who assist fellows in interview preparation, behavioral skills, data structures and algorithms, problem solving, and being an overall strong engineer.

## 🔭 Current Goals
- Practice Data Structures and Algorithms!
- Complete projects!
- Find a strong open source project!
